            <p class="presentation__content__text">Hello, I'm Carlos Vinícius Bezerra Sampaio, I'm a Front-end developer and intending to enter the programming job market. I'm a law graduate, but I've never seen myself working as a lawyer, I always wanted to take a course in computer engineering or something related to computers, at the time I studied law there was no college of computer engineering in my area.</p>
            <p class="presentation__content__text">What made me look for programming was not only the market demand, but also the taste for the computer, playing with the computer has always been fun for me, content related to computers instigate my curiosity, and I believe that I have a certain ease in learning related topics. With that in mind I signed up for Alura ( The biggest technology school in Brazil), I took several courses there and also some extra courses on the internet.</p>
            <p class="presentation__content__text">I've been studying programming for a few months, at the moment I'm a front-end developer , with the intention of becoming a full-stack DEV, I already know a lot about the front-end, but at the moment I haven't delved into the backend yet. I have some familiarity with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. My next steps are to start with the backend and learn more about React, Angular and others.</p>
